# tweetweather

This project consumes the accuweather service, and posts temperature and conditions to a twitter account of your choice. 

In order for it to work, you need to create a twitter app, and an accuweather app on developer.accuweather.com, and get:

* From twitter, an consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret
* From accuweather, the city code of choice and the apikey of your app
